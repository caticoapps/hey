      <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
      <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>


      <h2>Minors</h2>
      <p>The Services are not directed to individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under age 18. By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 18. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us.</p>


      <h2>Choices</h2>

      	<li><b>Device permissions</b>: Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect certain device data information via our mobile apps, such as stored data or push notifications. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features, which require these permissions.</li>
      	<li><b>Close Your Account</b>: While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services, you can delete your account. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above, for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
